Quick overview
The project is a 3D calculator interface surfacing inside a holographic plane. It uses a modern web toolkit to deliver a polished look with depth, light, and glow. Users interact with the keypad, sliders, and 3D panels as if the UI floats in space. Behind the visuals lies a robust calculator engine that parses expressions, evaluates results, and presents feedback instantly. The design aims for clarity and precision, with a strong emphasis on responsive behavior and accessibility where possible.

Visual identity and themes
Theme options power the look and feel of the calculator. Each theme changes the lighting, color palette, and background atmosphere to match a mood or setting. The themes include:
- Holographic: A high-contrast, crystal-clear glow with soft prisms and transparent panels. Numbers pop with a bright cyan glow. The scene emphasizes a sci-fi vibe and clean lines.
- Neon City: A darker urban glow with neon accents. The UI sits among a city-like backdrop, with moving light trails and reflective surfaces.
- Cosmic: A space-inspired look with deep purples and star-like particles. The UI floats amid nebulae and distant stars.
- Matrix: A green-on-black palette with digital rain-like streaks in the background and a modular, grid-like feel.

Each theme affects several aspects:
- Background scene and camera angle
- Light colors, intensities, and shadows
- Material finishes of UI components
- Particle color and behavior
- Typeface emphasis and iconography

There are simple, clear cues to indicate the current mode: glow intensity, edge highlights, and a subtle parallax shift as you move the pointer or touch the scene. The aim is to deliver a cohesive experience that feels both familiar and novel.

Core features
- 3D holographic calculator UI: A calculator that appears as floating panels in a 3D space.
- Multiple themes: Holographic, Neon City, Cosmic, Matrix, with seamless switching.
- Particle effects: Subtle ambient particles that react to UI actions and math operations.

How the 3D scene is built
- The base shell uses Next.js to provide a fast, SEO-friendly scaffold and server-side rendering where appropriate.
- The 3D scene is constructed with Three.js, providing a robust WebGL renderer and shader support for glow and refraction effects.
- React Three Fiber sits on top of Three.js to enable declarative scene composition with React components.
- Drei is used for common helpers (OrbitControls, useGLTF, anchors, etc.) to reduce boilerplate.
- The calculator UI is modeled as a set of 3D panels and buttons, with geometry designed to resemble floating cards.
- Interaction handling relies on raycasting to detect user clicks or taps on 3D elements, mapping those inputs to calculator operations.
- Thematic lighting uses physically informed materials and color temperatures to achieve the distinctive glow of each theme.
- Particle systems are implemented with lightweight shaders and point sprites to create ambient ambience that responds to input.
- Responsiveness is achieved by calculating layout constraints based on viewport size and camera distance, ensuring the UI remains legible at different scales.

Tech stack and architecture
- Frontend framework: Next.js for the app shell and route management.
- 3D rendering: Three.js for the scene, WebGL context, and materials.
- React integration: React Three Fiber for a React-centric approach to 3D components.
- Helpers and utilities: Drei for common primitives, shapes, cameras, and controls.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS for design tokens and utility-first styling that scales with the theme and screen size.
- Type safety: TypeScript to prevent runtime type errors and improve maintainability.
- Asset handling: GLTF assets and textures for UI panels, calculator keys, and decorative elements.
- State management: Local component state for UI and a small set of hooks to coordinate 3D actions with 2D UI.
- Math engine: A lightweight expression parser to handle typical calculator input and evaluation, with support for operator precedence, parentheses, and error handling.

Theming and customization
Theme engine
- Theme data is encapsulated in a dedicated module. It exposes color tokens, lighting scenes, and materials to apply across the UI.
- Switching themes updates scene lighting, panel colors, particle hues, and background elements.
- Theme switching is designed to be instantaneous and non-disruptive to user inputs. The transition uses gentle crossfades to reduce jank.

Customizing colors and materials
- You can override theme tokens by editing the theme files or providing a custom theme module.
- Materials use physically based rendering (PBR) to produce believable metallic and glass-like finishes.
- Lighting employs a mix of ambient, point, and directional lights to mimic real-world light behavior.
- Visual emphasis is placed on contrast between digits and the background to keep readability high, even when the scene is richly illuminated.

Tailwind-powered styling
- The UI uses Tailwind CSS utilities to ensure consistent spacing, typography, and responsive behavior.
- Utility classes map to design tokens like radius, shadow, and color scales so changes stay cohesive across components.
- The combination of Tailwind and 3D components helps keep the layout predictable across themes and screen sizes.

3D interactions and controls
Orbit-like navigation
- The scene supports intuitive rotation and panning while preserving the layout of the calculator panels.
- Dragging with the mouse or finger rotates the camera around the scene center, revealing different angles of the holographic UI.

Interaction model
- Raycasting detects user clicks or taps on 3D elements. When you press a key or tap a keypad button, an event triggers the corresponding calculator action.
- Keyboard support enables focus-driven navigation for essential functions like clearing input, deleting characters, and submitting expressions.
- Haptics and subtle feedback: When you interact, you observe slight lighting changes or a soft pulse to confirm action without overpowering the visuals.

Particle effects
- Particles provide a sense of depth and motion that enhances the holographic feel.
- They respond to certain events, such as key presses, results, or theme changes.
- The particle system is tuned to avoid overwhelming the scene while still delivering a sense of energy.
- Performance-conscious: Particles run in a separate update loop with capped counts to maintain smooth frame rates.

Expression engine and math handling
- The calculator supports standard arithmetic operations, parentheses, and operator precedence.
- It parses input into tokens and builds an evaluation plan that respects mathematical rules.
- It handles syntax errors gracefully and offers helpful feedback when the expression is invalid.
- The engine keeps a history of recent calculations for quick recall and review.

History, logging, and data model
- Expression history stores recent calculations with timestamps and results.
- History can be cleared or filtered to focus on specific calculations.
- Data models define the shape of an entry, including input expression, result, and status.
- The UI includes a compact history pane that can be docked on a side panel or hidden for a clean view of the 3D scene.

User interface and accessibility
- The main UI is a combination of 3D panels and 2D overlays that present controls clearly.
- Keypad buttons have large hit targets and readable labels.
- Text contrast is optimized for legibility against the glowing background.
- When possible, the app respects prefers-reduced-motion settings and provides a minimal motion alternative.

Performance and optimization
- Rendering uses a carefully chosen balance of visual fidelity and speed.
- The scene uses efficient materials and batching to minimize draw calls.
- The 3D scene adapts to viewport changes to keep the layout consistent on small screens.
- Debugging aids are available to inspect frame times and memory usage.

Testing strategy
- Unit tests cover the math engine, event handlers, and utility functions.
- Integration tests verify the interaction flow from input to result rendering.
- Visual regression tests focus on theme switching and UI layout across devices.
- End-to-end tests exercise the core user journey from opening the app to obtaining results.

Localization and accessibility notes
- The project is primarily in English, but the architecture can support localization in the UI text layers.
- Accessibility basics are considered, with keyboard focus and readable text. The 3D scene itself is a visual interface, so screen reader support is ongoing work; plan for future enhancement if needed.

Code quality and tooling
- The codebase follows consistent TypeScript patterns with explicit types.
- Linting and formatting rules keep the codebase maintainable.
- A modular approach helps new contributors locate areas to modify or extend.

Extensibility and plugins
- Theme modules are designed to be plug-and-play. You can add new themes by creating a module that exports the color tokens, lighting configuration, and any decorative assets.
- The 3D scene is componentized so you can replace specific panels or swap models without rewriting core logic.
- The math engine is isolated from the UI. You can swap in alternative parsers or evaluators if you need advanced features.

UI components and widgets
- Keypad: A 3D keypad with responsive sizing and tactile feedback.
- Display panels: 3D panels that show current input, the computed result, and history preview.
- Control bar: Theme switchers, reset actions, and quick toggles.
- History panel: A collapsible 3D/2D hybrid area that lists past calculations.
- Help and information: Inline tooltips and a help panel that describes available operators and functions.

Styling approach and Tailwind usage
- Tailwind tokens drive spacing, typography, and color scales.
- Design tokens are centralized so color changes propagate consistently.
- Custom CSS handles specific 3D-related styling like glow intensity, edge highlights, and custom shader parameters.
- The combination of Tailwind and 3D components yields predictable, responsive layouts across themes.

API surface and types
- Public types define expressions, results, and history entries.
- A minimal set of hooks orchestrates 3D scene state with UI logic.
- The public API is intentionally small to reduce coupling and ease migration.

Versioning and releases
- Release notes live in the release pages, with highlights about new themes, performance improvements, and bug fixes.
- The showcased release assets can be downloaded and executed from the official releases area. The hub link at the start of this document directs you to the latest packages; using the badge link in this document provides quick access to the same destination.

Troubleshooting and known issues
- If the 3D scene stalls on startup, verify your browserâ€™s WebGL support and GPU driver status.
- For theme switching delays, ensure the scene has finished loading textures and shaders before applying a transition.
- If input feels unresponsive on touch devices, check for correct pointer event capturing and ensure that 3D raycasting is configured for your device.
- If the app struggles on older hardware, consider lowering particle density or disabling nonessential shaders via the theme switcher.

Roadmap and future work
